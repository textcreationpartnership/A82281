            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PRESENT CASE OF ENGLAND, AND THE <hi>PROTESTANT INTEREST.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>SInce the preſent condition of the Kingdom, and the whole Proteſtant Intereſt by the conjunction of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> abroad, and a more horrid combination of ſeveral at home, muſt needs affect with the moſt melancholy Reflections all true Engliſh Hearts, all ſuch as have any real love or zeal for their Religion, or their native Country. I cannot think it amiſs to preſent a ſhort and impartial View to ſuch as have not conſidered the ſame.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the laſt Age, the Proteſtant Intereſt in <hi>Europe</hi> was more than a Match for the Roman Catholick; the Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia</hi> was almoſt all Proteſtant; near half the Subjects of <hi>Hungary,</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and <hi>Moravia,</hi> were Proteſtant (and did many times defend themſelves by force againſt the Emperor himſelf, when oppreſs'd by him for the ſake of their Religion.) That in <hi>Germany,</hi> the Houſes of <hi>Newburgh</hi> were Proteſtant, the <hi>Palatinates</hi> for the moſt part of them Proteſtant, of the ſtricteſt ſort; the <hi>Saxons</hi> entirely Proteſtant, and being hearty unanimous, and ſeated in the midſt of <hi>Germany,</hi> were a Bulwark and Defence to the Proteſtants of many other leſſer States as often as they were oppreſs'd for their Religion, by their own or their neighbouring Princes: That many of the Subjects of <hi>Bava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, Bamburgh, Cologn, Wurtzburgh</hi> and <hi>Worms</hi> were Proteſtants. Beſides theſe,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:152931:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>that the Proteſtants of <hi>France</hi> were ſo powerful, as to maintain 8 or 9 Civil Wars in defence of their Religion, and always came off with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. The <hi>Vaudois</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> were all of them Proteſtant, and great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Inhabitants of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Low Countries were of the Reform'd Religion. Beſides <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and the Northein Kingdoms of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> and the Dutchy of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> were intirely Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. But now inſtead of this, is not the Proteſtant Power deſtroyed almoſt over <hi>Europe?</hi> The whole Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia</hi> entirely Popiſh? Are not the Proteſtants of <hi>Poland, Austria, Moravia</hi> utterly deſtroyed? Is not their deſtruction now carrying on, and almoſt finiſh'd in <hi>Hungary?</hi> In <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>Newburghers</hi> of Proteſtants are become fierce Enemies of the Proteſtant Religion. The Proteſtants of <hi>Bavaria, Bamburgh, Cologn, Wurtz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> and <hi>Worms</hi> are all deſtroyed. In <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Low Countries, <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Vaudois,</hi> after long and mighty Struggles, the Religion is utterly extinguiſhed. Againſt the poor <hi>Palatines</hi> the Perſecution is now car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on with its uſual barbarity, and their Neighbours the <hi>Saxons</hi> are ſo far from being able to help them, that they are under the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Apprehenſions of ſuffering the like from their own Prince (lately turned Roman Catholick to obtain the Kingdom of <hi>Poland</hi>) ſo ſoon as his Wars with <hi>Sweden,</hi> and other troubles created him by his Poliſh and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuanian Subjects will give him leave. Beſides this, two Northern Princes have given great cauſe to ſuſpect their Converſion to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Religion: That <hi>Sweden</hi> by its ſeparation from the reſt of <hi>Europe</hi> by the <hi>Baltick,</hi> is unable to give aſſiſtance to the Proteſtants in any part of <hi>Europe,</hi> without the conſent of the <hi>German</hi> Princes bordering on the Baltick, which will never be granted by Papiſts in favour of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.</p>
            <p>Thus the Proteſtant Religion which had ſpread it ſelf over almoſt all <hi>Europe,</hi> which had gain'd the entire poſſeſſions of ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, the greater part of others, and migghty Intereſt in moſt, has through the reſtleſs malice and endeavours of its Enemies, been ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and deſtroyed in Country after Country, till it is at laſt reduced to a little Corner of what it once poſſeſt (<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Hollond</hi>) And do we think our Enemies will not accompliſh (what they have thus proſperouſly carried on ſo far) our utter Deſtruction? Is it not high time then to think our ſelve, in danger, to look about us to enquire what it is hath thus weaken'd us, brought us ſo near our ruin, what meaſures will certainly accompliſh it, and what we muſt take for, the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.</p>
            <p>The Romiſh Methods of converting the Proteſtants have been in all Countries the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> Confiſcation of their Eſtates, Goals and Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonments, Fire, and Sword, dragooning and maſſacring, and inflicting the moſt inhuman Torments that rage and fury cou'd invent upon ſuch, whoſe Reſolution and Zeal for their Religion cou'd not be moved by the former means.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:152931:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>If this be the true caſe of <hi>England,</hi> and the Proteſtant Religion, then what is wanting to give the finiſhing ſtroke to our deſtruction, but only an ability in the King of <hi>France</hi> to break the Powers of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And when we conſider how in the year 1672. the King of <hi>France</hi> marched his Army through the midſt of <hi>Flanders,</hi> fell directly upon <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> then unprovided, enter'd their ſtrongeſt Towns like open Villages; ſome without defence, or almoſt denial, moſt of them without any blows at all, and all of them with very few, and made himſelf Maſter of three parts of <hi>Holland</hi> in two Months time; for which Sir <hi>W. T.</hi> K. <hi>C.</hi> II's Ambaſſador (then in <hi>Holland</hi>) tells us the reaſon was, That the <hi>Dutch</hi> then not ſuſpecting ſuch a thing had no Field-Army ſufficient to encounter their Enemies, or ſuccour any Town: That walled Towns will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Men within, unleſs the Hearts of the Men will defend their Walls: That no Garriſon will make any reſolute defence, without the proſpect or hopes at leaſt of relief. 'Tis true, that the <hi>French</hi> King having then all <hi>Flanders</hi> on his back, gariſon'd with <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Troops (then his implacable Enemies) a powerful Army of the <hi>German</hi> Princes marching upon him down the <hi>Rhine; Spain</hi> and <hi>England</hi> (alarm'd by his ſucceſſes) preparing to attack him on all quarters, was glad to vomit up all again, and return home with as much precipitancy, as he had invaded them, leaſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and retreat of his Army through <hi>Flanders</hi> ſhould be cut off. But now the caſe is otherwiſe, he has poſſeſs'd himſelf of <hi>Flanders,</hi> extended his Dominion to the very Frontiers of <hi>Holland;</hi> Spain <hi>is all united to him, ſome</hi> German <hi>Princes (then his Enemies) are now become his Friends; others enter'd into conditions of Neutrality with him:</hi> And ſhould he now by a fatal Battle (which God of his infinite mercy forbid) break the <hi>Dutch</hi> Army, which they have with infinite Charge and matchleſs Vigour, gathen'd up from <hi>Denmark, Brandenburgh,</hi> and other remote Countries of <hi>Germany,</hi> might he not enter the heart of their Country? And whence then can their ſtrong Cities and Towns depend upon relief? May he not as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enter 'em like open Villages? May he not as formerly poſſeſs himſelf of their whole Country in leſs than one Campaign? It was the opinion of that great Stateſman, Sir <hi>W. T.</hi> That <hi>Holland</hi> wou'd make a ſtout reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in any quarrel remote from their own doors; but that which ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles them (their Wealth) to carry on a foreign War with Vigour, wou'd in a War at home render 'em defenceleſs: Rich and populous Towns are not fit for Sieges, or were ever known to make any long and reſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. If this be our caſe, if the whole power of the Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reſts now in a manner in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland;</hi> if the deſtruction of <hi>England,</hi> as well as of our holy Religion, muſt inevitably follow the loſs of <hi>Holland.</hi> If <hi>Holland</hi> by one unfortunate Battle might happen to be loſt in one Campaign or leſs, Are we not in a moſt ſad and deplorable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? and if ſome Men are without their Fears, Have we not the greater reaſon to fear for our ſelves, our Religion, and our Country.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:152931:3"/>What ſhou'd we judg of thoſe who tell us, 'tis too early yet for <hi>England</hi> to declare? The Enemy has raiſed his Armies, furniſh'd his Magazines; and 'tis too early for us to think of raiſing a Man. The Enemy is before our Outworks, and 'tis too ſoon for us to prepare our ſelves to be on our guard: Will not thoſe Men tell us, when <hi>Holland</hi> is loſt, 'twill then be too late? To what purpoſe (will they ſay) now do you think of raiſing Forces? Is not the <hi>French</hi> King Maſter of <hi>Holland?</hi> Poſſeſs'd of all their Ports? Where will you land them? To what uſe will you put 'em? Does not ſuch Language as this plainly ſhew the intention of the Authors? Is it not plainly to deliver us blindfold, bound hand and foot into the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hand? Is not their deſign now ſo viſible as not to be diſguiſed? Do not ſome of the Party begin to throw off the Mask, and tell us, 'Twill not be well with us till our old Maſter returns, till the Government returns to its natural Channel. And are not thoſe that were the very Tools and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Popery and Arbitrary Power in former Reigns, and that owe their Lives to Acts of Indemnity in this, induſtriouſly repreſented by ſome as the Patriots of their Country; and by a ſtrange kind of Paradox thoſe that have been always hearty for the Church, and were for defending of it when others were for pulling it down; that were hearty for the King's Acceſſion to the Throne, and to his Perſon and Government ever ſince, are repreſented as betrayers of us, as having ſold us to <hi>France:</hi> Would it not be a piece of rare refin'd Policy, if <hi>France</hi> could hang up her greateſt Enemies, under the Notion of her deareſt Friends, and give Encouragement to her antient Friends, under the Notion of being her Enemies?</p>
            <p>Let us therefore while it is yet in our power (as we tender our Religion and our Country) uſe our utmoſt Endeavours by all legal ways to aſſiſt his Majeſty and his Government, againſt all his and our Enemies both at home and abroad.</p>
